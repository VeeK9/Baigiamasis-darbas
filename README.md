# CodeAcademy final React project

This final project was made by me. Duh.

## Requirements

You have to have node.js & npm already installed

## Booting up the project

1. Download or clone this repository: [Baigiamasis_Darbas](https://github.com/VeeK9/Baigiamasis-darbas.git)
2. Using the terminal of your choice, navigate to the main directory of the project.
3. Install all of the used packages - npm i
4. Start the json server (it will create a server on a 8080 port) - npm run json 
5. Open another terminal, navigate to the same directory and start the project (it will open a project on http://localhost:3000) - npm start

#### See you on another side ( I mean see you in Employment Services office probably)
